The dataset variables (from a total of 12 variables) are span in 3 different types:
<ul>
    <li><b>factor</b> with character values;</li>
    <li><b>datatime</b> with data and time values;</li>
    <li><b>factor</b> numeric with integer and decimal numbers</li>
</ul>


In general the data is clean. Not all variables were used to answer the questions proposed, but three new variables were created:
<ul>
    <li><b><i>month</i></b> with the month that the bike was hired (January to December);</li> 
    <li><b><i>week_day</i></b> with the week day that the bike was hired (Monday to Sunday); </li> 
    <li><b><i>station_travel</i></b> join the <i>start_station</i> and <i>end_station</i> to have in just one variable the journey
        of each user. </li> 
</ul>

Just "Male" and "Female" observations in the <b><i>gender</i></b> variable were considered. The "Unknown" observations were deleted.

The variable <b><i>birth_age</i></b> has an unexpected observation (1887). None action was took because this variable was not managed, but 
in the further studies this value should not be considered.

No missing values (NA) were deleted once it could delete useful observations. The NA values were managed (not considered) 
particularly when to make visualizations.

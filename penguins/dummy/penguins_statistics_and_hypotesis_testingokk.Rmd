We are interested in how **bill length** differs between the three species of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap & Gentoo) of penguins dataset from the 'palmer penguins' package.

### Bill Length Data Distribution {.tabset}

A **boxplot** is a useful way to look at the distribution of our data. By specie, will be done a preview analysis to know how bill length is distributed.

### `<details> `{=html}

### `<summary> Expand for boxplot interpretation explanation </summary> `{=html}

The central box corresponds to the interquartile range of data distribution (IQR). 50% of values falling in the IQR which is limited by Q1 to Q3. Values beyond the whiskers on both sides are normally considered outliers.

![](images/bloxplot.jfif)

The bar inside the central box represents the median (Q2) and shows the data symmetry and skewness. The skewness refers to distortion or asymmetry in a normal distribution in a dataset.

-   **symmetric distribution**, The median is in the middle of the box, and the lengths of the whiskers are about the same on both sides;

-   **distribution is positively skewed (skewed right)**, The median is closer to the bottom of the box (Q1), the whisker is shorter on the lower end of the box.

-   **distribution is negatively skewed (skewed left)**, The median is closes to the top of the box and the whisker is shorter on the upper end of the box.

**Adelie:** Bill length distribution is symmetric and has no outliers.

**Chinstrap:** asymmetric distribution - negatively skewed (skewed left).

1.  **median position:** the median value is not centered on the IQR, but shifted to the right. It is visible by the scale of bill length, where from Q1 to Q2 the difference is about 3 mm, and between Q2 and Q3 is less than 1 mm.
2.  **whisker:** in a left-skewed, is expected that the whisker is shorter on the upper end of the box than the lower end. However in this case it is not verified once that the upper whisker has a length of 7mm (from 51mm to 58mm) and the other hand the the lower whisker has a length of 5.5mm (from 41mm to 46.5mm, approximated values);
3.  **outliers:** All values are between the upper and lower whisker which means that there are no outliers. However, some values seem isolated and far away from the most distribution of values, like values above 55mm. The fact that the upper whisker is higher than lower, is the reverse that would be expected to influence this isolate value.

**Gentoo[:]{.smallcaps}** the distribution is positively skewed (skewed right).

1.  **median position:** Although not accentuated, the median value is not centred on the IQR, but slightly shifted to the left;
2.  **whisker:** as expected in a positively skewed, the whisker is shorter on the lower end of the box;
3.  **outliers:** there are outliers; at least one value is beyond the upper whisk.

## Summary statistics Analysis

```

**The Skewness** in a distribution refers to its asymmetry, indicating a tendency to be distorted either to the left (negative value, where centrality measures typically fall in the order mean \< median \< mode) or to the right (positive value, where measures fall in the order mode \< median \< mean). The magnitude of skewness is determined by the absolute value of skewness.

**The standard deviation (sd)** is a measure indicating the average amount by which values in a distribution deviate from the mean. It provides insight into the dispersion of observations within the distribution. In the case of a normal distribution, it is expected that:

***mean vs median*** The mean is more heavily swayed by outliers than the median. Looking for the results obtained, there are a relatively small difference between the mean and median values per specie in bill_length_mm variable, what take us to think that the number of outliers are relatively small or even non-existent.

**Skewness**

-   **Adelie:** skewness = 0.156, then the distribution of values in relation of asymmetry tends to be distorted the right. As the absolute skewness value is less than 0.5, the classification of skewness magnitude is classified as fairly symmetrical.
-   **Chinstrap:** skewness = -0.089, then tends to be distorted the left. Absolute value (=0.089) is less than 0.5 then the in relation to the magnitude is classified as fairly symmetrical. Mean value is lower than median as expected for centrality measures in a left skewness.
-   **Gentoo:** skewness = 0.604, then tends to be distorted the right. About the magnitude is classified as moderately skewed once the absolute value (=0.604) is between 0.5 and 1.

**Standard deviation** (sd)

-   **Adelie:** is expected that 68% of values are between 36.161 (mean - sd) and 41.487 (mean + sd);
-   **Chinstrap:** is expected that 68% of values are between 45.495 and 52.173.

**Gentoo:** expected that 68% of values are between 44.462 and 50.674.

## Hypothesis test & Probability

Performed a hypothesis test to check whether the mean bill length of Gentoo is significantly longer than the mean bill length of Adelie.

<summary> Expand for Theory Concepts</summary>

**Significance level**: is a pre-determined threshold for the p-value determining whether we reject H0 or not. The significance level defines Type I error, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.

**Null distribution**: is a sampling distribution, typically generated using bootstrap methods, representing what one would expect if the null hypothesis (H0) were true. In essence, H0 is employed to simulate this null sampling distribution.

**p-value**: signifies the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the obtained value, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It serves as the smallest significance level at which we would reject the null hypothesis, considering the observed sample statistic.

The visualization shows that the observed statistic (8.713487) is beyond our null distribution (representation of a sampling distribution of H0). With the observed statistic value far from any tail side of the null distribution, it means that there is no probability of getting a value under the null distribution, and this way we reject H0.

A type I error (false positive) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is not false. It means that are a 5% (significance level equal to 0,05) of probability rejecting the hypothesis that the difference of the means of the bill length by species is equal, being this hypothesis true.

The p-value is lower than the significance level (0.05), so there is strong evidence to reject H0 in favour of H1. Therefore, there is strong evidence that the average of bill length the Gentoo species is longer than the average of the Adelie species.

## Correlation Analysis  {.tabset}

Correlation analysis between bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across species. 

### Correlation Matrix

<details>

<summary>Expand for Theory Concepts</summary>

The correlation provides both the **direction** and the **strength** of a linear relationship between two variables. The direction could be negative or positive and the strength is measured by the correlation coefficient (r) limited from -1 to +1.

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

correlation <- data.frame(
  magnitude_rxy        = c("0", "0.01 - 0.19", "0.20 - 0.39", "0.40 - 0.59", 
                           "0.60 - 0.79", "0.80 - 0.99", "1"),
  strength_correlation = c("none", "very weak", "weak", "moderate",
                           "strong", "very strong", "perfect")
)
correlation %>% 
  kable(
    x = .,
    align = "c",
    col.names = c("Magnitude r(x, y)", "Correlation Strength")
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "float_right",
    bootstrap_options = c("basic", "responsive")) %>% 
  row_spec(0, background = "#FFF2CC", color = "black") 
```

How much closer the correlation coefficient (r) is to 1, stronger would be the linear relationship between two variables. Intermediate values indicate that variables tend to be related.

-   **Null Correlation:** a correlation equal to 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables; the variables are independent.
-   **Positive Correlation:** with a correlation of +1 the two random variables have a perfect positive linear relationship, therefore, a specific value of one variable, X, predicts the other variable, Y, exactly. The variables are positively dependent.
-   **Negative Correlation:** a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship between two variables, with one variable, X, predicting the negative of the other variable, Y. Perfect negative linear dependency is indicated by a correlation of -1.

The magnitude to classify the strength of the correlation between variables is shown in the following table:

</details>

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

r_plot <- penguins %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  ggcorr(label = TRUE, 
         geom        = "tile",
         label_size  = 4,
         label_round = 2,
         label_color = "black")

r_plot + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#FFFCF5")) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#FFFCF5"))
```

<div class="result_analysis">

<p class="title_result_analysis"> Analysis</p>

The length of the penguin's bill has a negative weak correlation with the depth of the bill (r = -0.24) and a strong positive and strong correlation with the length of the flipper (r = 0.66) and the weight (r = 0.6).

Therefore, with a weak dependency (weak linear relationship), it is not reasonable to make predictions of the penguing's bill length through the bill depth.

On the other hand, we could look by the length of the flipper and the weight to predict the length of the penguin's bill, once both physical characteristics have a strong linear relationship with the bill´s length, reveling dependency from each other.

            The central box corresponds to the interquartile range of data distribution (IQR). 50% of values falling in the IQR which is 
            limited by Q1 to Q3. Values beyond the whiskers on both sides are normally considered outliers.

            The bar inside the central box represents the median (Q2) and shows the data symmetry and skewness. Skewness is the distortion or 
            asymmetry in a normal distribution.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Symmetric distribution:</b> the median is in the middle of the box, and the lengths of the whiskers are about the same on both sides;</li>
                <li><b>Distribution is positively skewed (right skewed)</b> the median is closer to the bottom of the box (Q1), and the whisker is shorter on the 
                    lower end of the box.</li>
                    <li><b>Distribution is negatively skewed (left skewed)</b> the median is close to the top of the box and the whisker is shorter on the upper 
                        end of the box.</li>

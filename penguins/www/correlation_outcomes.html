The length of the penguin's bill has a negative weak correlation with the depth of the bill (r = -0.24) and a strong positive and strong
 correlation with the length of the flipper (r = 0.66) and the weight (r = 0.6).

With a weak dependency (weak linear relationship), it is not reasonable to make predictions of the 
penguin's bill length through the bill depth.

On the other hand, we could look at the length of the flipper and the weight to predict the length of the 
penguin's bill. Both those physical characteristics have a strong linear relationship with the bill's length, revealing dependency from each other.

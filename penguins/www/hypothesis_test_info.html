            <b>Significance level:</b> is a pre-determined threshold for the p-value determining whether we reject H0 or not. The significance level 
            defines Type I error, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.

            <b>Null distribution:</b> is a sampling distribution, typically generated using bootstrap methods, representing what one would expect if the null 
            hypothesis (H0) were true. In essence, H0 is employed to simulate this null sampling distribution.

            <b>p-value:</b> signifies the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the obtained value, assuming the 
            null hypothesis is true. It serves as the smallest significance level at which we would reject the null hypothesis, considering the observed sample statistic.

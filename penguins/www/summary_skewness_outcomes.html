<b>Skewness</b> to know how tends the distribution of the observations 
<ul>
    <li><b>Adelie (skewness = 0.156)</b> , tends to be distorted to the right, and about the skewness magnitude 
        classification is fairly symmetrical (|skewness| < 0.5).</li>
    <li><b>Chinstrap (skewness = -0.089)</b> , tends to be distorted to the left. About the skewness magnitude classification 
        is fairly symmetrical (|skewness| < 0.5)</li>
    <li><b>Gentoo (skewness = 0.604)</b> , tends to be distorted to the right. About the skewness magnitude is 
        classified as moderately skewed (0.5 =< |skewness| =< 1) </li>
</ul>

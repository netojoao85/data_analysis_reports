            The correlation provides both the direction and the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The direction could be negative or 
            positive and the strength is measured by the correlation coefficient (r) limited from -1 to +1.
    
            <div class = "paragraph"></div>
    
            How much closer the correlation coefficient (r) is to 1, stronger will be the linear relationship between two variables. Intermediate 
            values indicate that variables tend to be related.
    
            <div class = "paragraph"></div>
    
            <ul>
                <li><b>Null Correlation:</b> a correlation equal to 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables; the variables are independent.</li>
                <li><b>Positive Correlation:</b> with a correlation of +1 the two random variables have a perfect positive linear relationship, therefore, a specific 
                    value of one variable, X, predicts the other variable, Y, exactly. The variables are positively dependent.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Negative Correlation:</b> a correlation of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship between two variables, with one variable, X, predicting 
                    the negative of the other variable, Y. Perfect negative linear dependency is indicated by a correlation of -1.</li>
            </ul>
    
            The magnitude to classify the strength of the correlation between variables is shown in the right table.

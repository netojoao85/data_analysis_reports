            <b>Skewness:</b> We can describe how symmetrical a distribution it is, this is called skewness. Skewness in a distribution refers to 
            asymmetry, to a tendency to be distorted to the left or right.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Left Skewed distribution:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skewness value < 0 </li>
                        <li>Centrality measures typically fall in the order: mean < median < |skewness| </li>
                        <li>In terms of visualisation, data will show the bulk of the data on the right of the plot, and the tail extending out to the left.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Right Skewed distribution:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skewness value > 0</li>
                        <li>Centrality measures typically fall in the order: |skewness| < median < mean </li>
                        <li>Data will show the bulk of the data on the right of the plot, and the tail extending out to the left.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
                
            <table class = "table_Skewness_magnitude">
                <tr>
                    <th>Magnitude of Skewness</th>
                    <th>Classification</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td> < 0.5 </td>
                    <td>fairly symmetrical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td> 0.5 - 1 </td>
                    <td>moderately skewed</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td> > 1 </td>
                    <td>highly skewed</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            The magnitude of the skewness is determined by the absolute value of skewness and can be interpreted on the right table:

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <b>Standard deviation (sd): </b> is a quantity expressing by how much, on average, the values in a distribution differ from the distribution 
            mean. This way we can to know how spread out the observations are. For a normal distribution, is expected that:

            <ul>
                <li>68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean</li>
                <li>95% of values would be within the two standard deviation, and</li>
                <li>99.7% within the 3 standard deviation.</li>
            </ul>

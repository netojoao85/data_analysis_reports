    <b>mean vs median:</b> The mean is more heavily swayed by outliers than the median. Looking at the results obtained, there is a relatively small 
    difference between the mean and median values per species in the <i>bill_length_mm</i> variable which makes us think that the number of outliers is 
    relatively small or even non-existent.

    <b>Skewness</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Adelie (skewness = 0.156).</b> The distribution of values about asymmetry tends to be distorted to the right. As the absolute skewness value is less 
            than 0.5, the skewness magnitude classification is fairly symmetrical.</li>
        <li><b>Chinstrap (skewness = -0.089)</b> tends to be distorted to the left. Absolute value (=0.089) is less than 0.5 then the about the magnitude is 
            classified as fairly symmetrical. The mean value is lower than the median as expected for centrality measures in a left skewness.</li>
        <li><b>Gentoo (skewness = 0.604)</b> tends to be distorted to the right. The magnitude is classified as moderately skewed once the absolute 
            value (=0.604) is between 0.5 and 1.</li>
    </ul>

    <b> Standard deviation (sd) </b>
    <ul Standard deviation (sd)>
        <li><b>Adelie:</b> expected that 68% of values are between 36.161mm (mean - sd) and 41.487mm (mean + sd);</li>
        <li><b>Chinstrap:</b> expected that 68% of values are between 45.495mm and 52.173mm.</li>
        <li><b>Gentoo:</b> expected that 68% of values are between 44.462mm and 50.674mm.</li>
    </ul>

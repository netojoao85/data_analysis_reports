    The observed statistic is 8.713 (marked with a red line) goes beyond the null distribution (representation of a sampling distribution of H0). With 
    the observed statistic value far from any tail side of the null distribution, it means that there is no probability of getting a 
    value under the null distribution, and this way H0 is rejected.
    <div class = "paragraph"></div>
    A type I error (false positive) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is not false. It means that are 
    5% (significance level equal to 0,05) of probability to reject the hypothesis that the difference of the means of the bill length by species is equal, being 
    this hypothesis true.
    <div class = "paragraph"></div>
    The p-value is lower than the significance level (0.05), so there is strong evidence to reject H0 in favour of H1 and conclude that the average of of bill 
    length of gentoo specie is longer than the average of adelie specie.
